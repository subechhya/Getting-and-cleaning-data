The data for the project is:

 https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

The program run_analysis.R  does the following. 

Sets up indices for variables with the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
features_mean_std_index and features_mean_std

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set:
combined_data

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
Activity_description
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject:
average_activity
